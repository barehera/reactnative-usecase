# 7Apps React - React Native Developer Position

## Task:

We are looking for a React Native developer to implement a multi-select autocomplete component using React Native. You will then use this component to search for characters in the "Rick and Morty" API.

API Link: [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#introduction)

## Assets:

Example design: assets/multi-select.png

## Requirements:

- React Native with Typescript
- Multi-select implementation according to the design
- Query entered in the input field is queried with the API and listed in the popup content
- Each character in the listed results should show the character image, name, and number of episodes they played in
- The entered query word should be highlighted in the listed results (in the example design, the search for 'ric' shows 'Ric' in bold)
- Adding and removing selected results to and from the input field
- Loading state indication
- Exception handling and error states displayed in the interface
- TailwindCSS is not required but is a plus

## Most importantly:

The architecture of the code you write should be clean and readable.

## Optional:

- APK build output

## Plus:

Write the same use case with Next.js and TailwindCSS. Add an extra feature of keyboard navigation support. Arrow keys and tab should be used to perform all operations, navigate selected items in the input field or rows in the result list, and perform deletion/selection operations.

## Please note:

This case study is designed to assess your React Native development skills. You are free to use any libraries or frameworks you deem necessary. The code you submit will be reviewed by our team. We appreciate your time and effort in completing this case study. Good luck!
