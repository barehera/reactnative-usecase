# 7Apps React - React Native Developer Position

## Task:

We are looking for a React Native developer to implement a multi-select autocomplete component using React Native. You will then use this component to search for characters in the "Rick and Morty" API.

API Link: [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#introduction)

## Assets:

Example design: assets/multi-select.png

## Requirements:

- React Native with Typescript
- Multi-select implementation according to the design
- Query entered in the input field is queried with the API and listed in the popup content
- Each character in the listed results should show the character image, name, and number of episodes they played in
- The entered query word should be highlighted in the listed results (in the example design, the search for 'ric' shows 'Ric' in bold)
- Adding and removing selected results to and from the input field
- Loading state indication
- Exception handling and error states displayed in the interface
- TailwindCSS is not required but is a plus

## Most importantly:

The architecture of the code you write should be clean and readable.

## Optional:

- APK build output
- Vercel deploy (if Next.js is implemented)

## Optional: Next.js and TailwindCSS Implementation with Keyboard Navigation

Implement the same use case using **Next.js** and **TailwindCSS**. 

### Extra Feature: Keyboard Navigation Support

- **Navigation**: Use arrow keys and tab to navigate through selected items in the input field or rows in the result list.
- **Operations**: Perform deletion/selection operations using the keyboard.

## Please note:
